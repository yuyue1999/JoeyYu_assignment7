# JoeyYu Assignment 7

This project is part of the assignment 7 repository for demonstrating basic Rust functionality.

## Project Structure

The project includes two main files:
- `main.rs`: The main entry point of the project.
- `lib.rs`: The library file that contains the core functionality.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): You can install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Cargo: Cargo is the Rust package manager, which is included with the Rust installation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuyue1999/JoeyYu_assignment7.git
   cd JoeyYu_assignment7
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   Once you are in the project directory, you can use `cargo` to build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

   This command will compile the project and all its dependencies.

3. **Run the Project**

   To run the project, use the following `cargo` command:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the main program and output the result.

4. **Run Tests**

   If the project includes tests (in `lib.rs` or other files), you can run them using:

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

   This command will execute all the tests in the project and show the results.

## Project Files

- **main.rs**: Contains the main function and entry point of the application.
- **lib.rs**: Contains additional functionality that can be imported into `main.rs` or other modules.

## Usage

The project is structured to allow easy modularization. You can extend the `lib.rs` file with additional functionality and use the modules in `main.rs`.
